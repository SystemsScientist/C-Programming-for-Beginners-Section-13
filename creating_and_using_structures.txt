Section 13: Creating and Using Structures
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview

	- structures in C provide another tool for grouping elements
	  together

		+ a powerful concept that you will use in many C
		  programs that you develop

	- suppose you want to store a date inside a program
	
		+ we could create variables for month, day, and year
		  to store the date, for example,

		  int month = 9, day = 25, year = 2015;

	- suppose your program also needs to store the date of
	  purchase of a particular item

		+ you must keep track of three separate variables
		  for each date that you use in the program

		+ these variables are logically related and should
		  be grouped together

	- it would be much better if you could somehow group these
	  sets of three variables together 

		+ this is precisely what the structure in C allows
		  you to do


Creating a Structure

	- a structure declaration describes how a structure is put
	  together

		+ what elements are inside the structure

	- the struct keyword enables you to define a collection
	  of variables of various types called a structure that
	  you can treat as a single unit

	  struct date {

		int month;
		int day;
		int year;
	  };

	- the above statement defines what a date structure looks
	  like to the C compiler

		+ there is no memory allocation for this
		  declaration

	- the variable names within the date structure are 
	  called members or fields

		+ members of the structure appear between the
		  braces that follow the struct tag name date


Using a Structure

	- the definition of date defines a new type in the
	  language

	  struct date today;

	- you can now declare more variables of type struct
	  date

	  struct date purchase_date;

	- the above statement declares a variable to be of
	  type struct date

		+ memory is now allocated for the variables
		  above

		+ memory is allocated for three integer 
		  values for each variable

	- be certain you understand the difference between
	  defining a structure and declaring variables of
	  the particular structure type


Accessing Members in a struct

	- now that you know how to define a structure and
	  declare structure variables, you need to be able
	  to refer to the members of a structure

	- a structure variable name is not a pointer
	
		+ you need a special syntax to access the
		  members

	- you refer to a member of a structure by writing
	  the variable name followed by a period, followed
	  by the member variable name

		+ the period between the structure variable
		  name and the member name is called the
		  member selection operator

		+ there are no spaces permitted between
		  the variable name, the period, and the
		  member name

	- to set the value of the day in the variable
	  today, you write

	  today.day = 25;
	  today.year = 2015;

	- to test the value of month to see if it is
	  equal to 12, you write

	  if(today.month == 12)
	  	next_month = 1; 


Example

struct date {

	int month;
	int day;
	int year;
};

struct date today;

today.month = 9;
today.day = 25;
today.year = 2015;

printf("Today's date is %i/%i/%.2i.\n", today.month, today.day, today.year);


Structures in Expressions

	- when it comes to the evaluation of expressions, structure
	  members follow the same rules as ordinary variables do

		+ division of an integer structure member by 
		  another integer is performed as an integer
		  division
		
		  century = today.year / 100 + 1;


Defining the Structure and Variable (at the same time)

	- you do have some flexibility in defining structure

		+ it is valid to declare a variable to be of a
		  particular structure type at the same time
		  that the structure is defined

		+ include the variable name (or names) before
		  the terminating semicolon of the structure
		  definition
		
		+ you can also assign initial values to the
		  variables in the normal fashion

		  struct date {

			int month;
			int day;
			int year;
		  } today;

	- in the above structure called today, it is declared
	  at the same time that the structure is defined

		+ today is a variable of type date


Un-named Structures

	- you also do not have to give a structure a tag
	  name

	  struct {

		int day;
		int year;
		int month;
	  } today;

	- a disadvantage of the above struct is that you
	  can no longer define further instances of the
	  structure in another statement

		+ all the variables of this structure
		  type that you want in your program 
		  must be defined in the one statement


Initializing Structures

	- initializing structures is similar to initializing
	  arrays

		+ the elements are listed inside a pair of
		  braces, with each element separated by a
		  comma

		+ the initial values listed inside the
	  	  curly braces must be constant expressions

		  struct date today = {7, 2, 2015};

	- just like an array initialization, fewer values
	  might be listed than are contained in the 
	  structure

	  struct date date1 = {12, 10};

	- sets date1.month 1o 12 and date1.day to 10 but
	  gives no initial value to date.year


Initializing Structures (continued)

	- you can also specify the member names in the
	  initialization list

		+ enables you to initialize the members
		  in any order, or to only initialize
		  specified members

	  	  .member = value;

		  struct date date1 = {.month = 12, .day = 10};

	- set just the year member of the date structure
	  variable today to 2015

	  struct date today = {.year = 2015};


Assignment with Compound Literals

	- you can assign one or more values to a structure
	  in a single statement using what is known as
	  compound literals

	  today = (struct date) {9, 25, 2015};

	- this statement can appear anywhere in the program

		+ it is not a declaration statement

		+ the type cast operator is used to tell the
		  compiler the type of the expression

		+ the list of values follows the cast and are
		  to be assigned to the members of the structure
		  in order

		+ listed in the same way as if you were
		  initializing a structure variable

	- you can also specify values using the .member
	  notation

	  today = (struct date) {.month = 9, .day = 25, .year = 2015};

	- the advantage of using this approach is that the
	  arguments can appear in any order
