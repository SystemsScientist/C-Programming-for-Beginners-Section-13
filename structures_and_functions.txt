Section 13: Structures and Functions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Structures as Arguments to Functions

	- after declaring a structure named Family, how do we
	  pass this structure as an argument to a function?

	struct Family {

		char name[20];
		int age;
		char father[20];
		char mother[20];
	};

	bool check_siblings(struct Family member1, struct Family member2) {

		if(strcmp(member1.mother, member2.mother) == 0)
			return true;
		else
			return false;
	}

	- this function has two parameters, each of which is
	  a structure


Structures as Arguments to Functions (continued)

	- you should use a pointer to a structure as an argument

		+ it can take quite a bit of time to copy large
		  structures as arguments as well as requiring
		  whatever amount of memory to store the copy
		  of the structure 

		+ pointers to structures avoid the memory 
		  consumption and the copying time (only a
		  copy of the pointer argument is made)

	bool check_siblings(struct Family *pmember1, struct Family *pmember2) {

		if(strcmp(pmember1 -> mother, pmember2 -> mother) ==)
			return true;
		else
			return false;
	}

	- you can also use the const modifier to not allow
	  any modification of the members of the struct
	  (what the struct is pointing to)

	bool check_siblings(Family const *pmember1, Family const *pmember2) {

		if(strcmp(pmember -> mother, pmember2 -> mother) == 0)
			return true;
		else
			return false;
		}


Pointers to Structures as Function Arguments

	- you can also use the const modifier to not allow
	  any modification of the pointers address

		+ any attempt to change those structures
		  will cause an error message during
		  compilation

	bool check_siblings(Family *const pmember1, Family *const pmember2) {

		if(strcmp(pmember1 -> mother, pmember2 -> mother) == 0)
			return true;
		else
			return false;
	}

	- the indirection operator in each parameter 
	  definition is now in front of the const keyword

		+ not in front of the parameter name

		+ you cannot modify the addresses stored
		  in the pointers

		+ its the pointers that are protected here,
		  not the structures to which they point

Returning a Structure from a Function

	- the function prototype has to indicate this 
	  return value in the normal way

	struct Date my_fun(void);

	- this is a prototype for a function taking no
	  arguments that returns a structure of type
	  Date

	- it is often more convenient to return a pointer
	  to a structure

		+ when returning a pointer to a structure,
		  it should be created on the heap


Example

struct funds {

	char bank[FUNDLEN];
	double bank_fund;
	char save[FUNDLEN];
	double save_fund;
};

double sum(struct funds moolah) {

	return (moolah.bank_fund + moolah.save_fund);
}

int main(void) {

	struct funds stan = {

		"Garlic-Melon Bank",
		4032.27,
		"Lucky's Savings and Loan",
		8543.94
	};

	printf("Stan has a total of $%.2f.\n", sum(stan));

	return 0;
}


Reminder

	- always use pointers when passing structures
	  to a function
		
		+ it works on older as well as newer C
		  implementations and that it is quick
		  (you just pass a single address)

	- however, you have less protection for your data

		+ some operations in the called function
		  could inadvertently affect data in the
		  original structure

		+ use const qualifier solves that problem

	- advantages of passing structures as arguments

		+ the function works with copies of the
		  original data, which is safer than
		  working with the original data

		+ the programming style tends to be 
	   	  clearer

	- main disadvantages to passing structures as
	  arguments

		+ older implementations might not handle
		  the code

		+ wastes time and space

		+ especially wasteful to pass large 
		  structures to a function that uses
		  only one or two members of the 
		  structure

	- programmers use structure pointers as function
	  arguments for reasons of efficiency and use
	  const when necessary

	- passing structures by value is most often done
	  for structures that are small
